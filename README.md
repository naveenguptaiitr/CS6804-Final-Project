# CS6804-Final-Project
Please refer to the drive link below to access the datasets used in this project.

The drive link contains two directories, CurveVel-A and FlatVel-A. These two directories are to be placed in root folder of the peoject. Each of the two dictories consists of amplitude data (seismic measurements) and its corresponding subsurface velocity model.

The file structure of the project after placing the data should look something like this.
